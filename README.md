This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Goals

- Work with SQL to interact with a MySQL database.
- Learn how to define table schemas and write queries
- Create a MySQL database to persist data for a simple chat client.
